# gometa

An implementation of OMeta in the Go programming language (golang).

From the [main OMeta page](http://tinlizzie.org/ometa):

> OMeta is a new object-oriented language for pattern matching. It is based on a variant of Parsing Expression Grammars (PEGs) which we have extended to handle arbitrary data types. OMeta's general-purpose pattern matching facilities provide a natural and convenient way for programmers to implement tokenizers, parsers, visitors, and tree transformers, all of which can be extended in interesting ways using familiar object-oriented mechanisms.

There are implementations of OMeta in JavaScript, C#, Scheme, Common Lisp, Python, Ruby, and, doubtless, numerous other languages.  There is no known need for one in Go.  However, I have an interest in Go, and interest in OMeta, and the best way to learn both seemed to be to implement the latter in the former.
